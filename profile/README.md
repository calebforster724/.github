# Hi there! 👋  

I’m a passionate and experienced software developer with a strong focus on building scalable, efficient, and maintainable systems. With years of hands-on experience, I’ve worked across various domains, from backend development to cloud infrastructure, and I’m always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
Here’s a glimpse of the tools and technologies I work with:  
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Go, Java, Rust  
- **Frameworks**: Django, Flask, React, Node.js, Spring Boot  
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis  
- **DevOps & Cloud**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Terraform  
- **Tools**: Git, CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins, Grafana, Prometheus  

## 🔭 Current Focus  
I’m currently diving deeper into **cloud-native development** and **distributed systems**, exploring how to build resilient and scalable applications. I’m also experimenting with **Rust** for systems programming and **WebAssembly** for performance-critical web applications.  

## 🌱 Always Learning  
I believe in continuous improvement. Right now, I’m exploring:  
- Advanced Kubernetes orchestration  
- Machine learning and AI integration in backend systems  
- Blockchain and decentralized applications
